This directory contains the sources for the 'logplayer' program. This
program is the logplayer of the predator-prey domain and can play back
the .log format files created by the server (if this option was turned
on in the conifuration file). The logplayer uses gtk and does not
visualize the situations. The standard monitor has to be started to
accomplish this.

To build the program, do the standard 
> ./configure
> ./make
> ./make install

loop.
