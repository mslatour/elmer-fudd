 * @brief This file contains a prey implementation that handles all
 * communication with the pursuit server. Four specific methods have
 * to be implemented in which the policy is specified. The default
 * behavior is such that the prey stands still 20% of the time and the
 * remaining 80% are divided over the free cells next to it.
