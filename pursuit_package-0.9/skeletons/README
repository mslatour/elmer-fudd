This directory contains several skeletons programs in which the
implementation of both the predators and the preys can be defined. The
predator and prey directory contain the default predator and prey
implementation respectively. The java_predator and the python_predator
directory contain skeleton programs in respectively the java and the
python language. You can also create your own skeleton in the
particular programming language that you favor as long as it supports
sockets.
