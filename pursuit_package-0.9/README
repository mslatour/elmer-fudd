o The software in this package is an implementation of the famous
  predator-prey or pursuit domain. It has been used in the course
  'Multiagent systems and Distributed AI' since spring 2002.

o This is the root directory of the package and contains the
  directories of the different programs that make up the pursuit
  program:

- pursuit   - this is the main program which models the world and
              handles the communication with the client (over UDP
              sockets)

- monitor - displays current state of the world [needs GLUT]

- logplayer - replays recorded games [needs gtk].

- skeletons - contains some basic examples for the predators/preys
              a Java, C++ and python version is available. 

o The server can be configured using the configuration file
  pursuit.conf, the monitor can be configured using the configuration
  file monitor.conf. Both files are located in their corresponding
  source directory.

o To start the server, one monitor and two preys and two predators use
  the script 'start.sh' located in this directory.

o The technical report located in the doc directory contains an
  extensive explanation of the program and how to work with
  it. Furthermore, for the bold ones, the source is richly documented
  using doxygen.

o The monitor uses the GL and glut libraries. If it is not installed, get
  it from http://www.mesa3d.org.

o To build the program and get the program running, do the following

./configure -C [-C option will use the cache file after first run]
./make 
./start.sh

o documentation of the source is not built by default. To build the
  documentation for a specific package, go to the specific directory
  (i.e., skeletons/predator and type 'make doc'). The html output will
  be written to the directory 'doc/html' relative to the current dir.

o We tried to compile the sources under Windows using Cygwin, but did
  not succeed for the logplayer, since we couldn't get gtk working
  under cygwin (suggestions are welcome). Furthermore, the configure
  script fails for the monitor on the GL library test. A (quick)
  work-around to get the components compiled do the following:
  cd pursuitbase; ./configure; make; cd ..               [standard]
  cd pursuit; ./configure; make; cd ..                   [standard]
  cd skeletons/prey; ./configure; make; cd ../..         [standard]
  cd skeletons/predator; ./configure; make; cd ../..     [standard]
  cd monitor/src;                                        [different]

  [create symbolics links to installed opengl libs]
  ln -s /usr/lib/w32api/libopengl32.a  /usr/X11R6/lib/libGL.a
  ln -s /usr/lib/w32api/libglu32.a  /usr/X11R6/lib/libGLU.a
  ln -s /usr/lib/w32api/libglut32.a  /usr/X11R6/lib/libGLUT.a

  [compile the sources]
  g++ Monitor.C MonitorParameters.C RGBcolor.C \
	-I../../pursuitbase/pursuitbase \
	../../pursuitbase/pursuitbase/Connection.C \
	../../pursuitbase/pursuitbase/GenericValues.C \
        -c pursuit_monitor.exe \
  	 -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lGL -lGLUT -lGLU		
  cd ../..;   ./start.sh                                 [standard]
